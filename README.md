# Mo.ProjectFilesToJson
A .NET console tool that scans a projectâ€™s folder structure, filters out unwanted files via .gitignore/custom patterns, and consolidates all remaining files into a single JSON or Human readable text output. This makes it easy to feed the consolidated output to LLM models like ChatGPT, enabling automatic documentation, code reviews, or expansions.
