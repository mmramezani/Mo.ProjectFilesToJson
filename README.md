# Mo.ProjectFilesToJson
 lightweight yet powerful console tool that scans entire projects—respecting .gitignore patterns and custom include/exclude filters—then merges all discovered files into a single JSON or human-readable output. Perfect for packaging a single file to feed into AI for documentation, code reviews, or feature expansion.
